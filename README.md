Top 5 Reasons Your Business Needs Texting
Today’s telecommunication is heavily saturated with spam and unwanted offers, causing many people to ignore incoming calls from unknown numbers. This often inhibits business opportunities, as many prospects don’t give callers a chance. 

Continuously sending emails and leaving voicemails is a dated approach to receiving a customer response. That’s why businesses are turning to text for a fresh way to make new connections, improve existing relationships, and provide important information. 

We have compiled our top 5 reasons <a href="https://blog.banter.io/benefits-of-texting/">text messaging<a/> positively impacts customer engagement, so your business can begin reaping the benefits.

Strengthen marketing
Let’s be honest. Most emails are easily overlooked, forgotten, and ignored. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to stand out in a jam-packed inbox, causing many businesses to miss opportunities. That’s why more and more businesses are seeking the benefits of texting, as it offers a competitive advantage when sharing information. 

Let’s break down the stats:

SMS messages have a 98% open rate. This is especially effective when sharing time-sensitive information, such as appointment confirmations, limited time promotions, and updated holiday hours. 
Text messages have a 209% higher response rate than phone and email. This can help businesses improve their ability to connect with new and existing clients by sending follow-up messages regarding appointment scheduling, product purchasing, service appraising, and more.
The average person takes 90 seconds to reply to an SMS, but 90 minutes to respond to an email. All it takes is a text to increase your productivity, close more sales, and quickly build your network. It’s almost too good to be true!

Broaden accessibility 
Texting introduces a convenient way to engage with your customers, whether it be to resolve an issue, provide more information, or reconnect. Also, texting allows those with speech impairments and those who are hard of hearing to reach your team. This alleviates communication barriers, making your business easily accessible for those who do not prefer phone calls or waiting for an email response. 

Improve support
As previously mentioned, texting is important when resolving customer issues. Allowing customers to share their feedback and open a service ticket via text makes it easy to communicate while on the go or when occupied with other tasks. This can boost their overall satisfaction with your support team, as they will not have to wait on the phone for someone to take their call and process their information. This also allows your team to maintain productivity, as they can handle multiple cases at once. A win-win!

Enhance collaboration
When employees are out of the office, their clients can easily be taken care of by another member in their department with texting. That’s the beauty of utilizing business numbers for benefits of texting, rather than personal numbers. Employees can then easily collaborate with each other to handle customer engagements so everyone remains on the same page, and no clients get left behind. 

Increase productivity
Texting is a game-changer when it comes to working on the go, multitasking, and reaching mass amounts of people at once. This exponentially saves time, allowing employees to focus more on critical projects. Business texting makes it easy to increase productivity within all business departments, so your team can manage their clients while also managing their daily tasks.
